- 👋 Hi, I’m @Andrii-STV

- 👀 I’m interested in front-end web development. I have worked with WordPress sites as a product designer for 2 years,
and now I am practicing creating more complex and customized web sites with HTML and CSS.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP to create complex websites that can be stored on the server, and JavaScript to strengthen my front-end skills.

- 💞️ I’m looking for the companies that are willing to consider me as a part of their team on the position of trainee/junior frontend developer
