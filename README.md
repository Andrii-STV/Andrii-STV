- 👋 Hi, I’m @Andrii-STV

- 👀 I’m interested in back-end web development. I have worked with WordPress sites as a product designer for 5+ years,
and now I am practicing creating more complex and customized apps with Node.js, Express, Axios, and PHP. 
 
- 🌱 I’m currently aiming to deepen my knowledge in the sphere of back-end development.

- 💞️ I've been dreaming of becoming a part of the Vinted team for half a year now :) I'm aiming to gain precious practical experience of working hand by hand with experienced developers and develop skills of teamwork with fellow members of Vinted Academy.
